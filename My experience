### University

Sice joining University I developed my skills in the following programming languages:
- C: learned in the first year, now I am working on the projects for the Operating Systems course
- C++: learned in highschool and made a huge progress in the Fundamental Algorithms course where I had to implement different data structures and algorithms such as heaps, hash tables, trees, graphs, etc;
- Java: learned in the second year, I have two projects so far and I have a growing interest in this language
- VHDL: learned in the first year when I made a pocket calculator and a train ticket vending machine
- SQL: learned in the second year, used it to connect a database to one of my Java projects
- Assembly: seemed an interesting language but I never had the time to study it properly
